# Raspberry Pi Robot
The objective of this project is to learn how to make a robot that will react to things around it and to keep a specific distance from them.  First and foremost, it is a learning experience.  There are other projects out there that do the same basic thing.  Very easy to copy, but little to nothing will be learned from just cloning a project.

This project starts with a blank sheet of paper and few ideas on how to get started.  It is open ended because the project is for fun and learning.

Current work is to create base classes that will handle distance functions, movement functions and rules for when to move and how much based on distance sensed.
